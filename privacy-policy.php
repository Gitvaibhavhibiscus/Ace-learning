      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="pptophead">At ACE, we value your trust and prioritize your privacy. Our Privacy Policy 
         outlines how we collect and handle your personal information. By visiting our site, 
         you agree to adhere to this policy. We gather both mandatory and optional personal 
         information as part of our services and ensure its protection. By registering with ACE, 
         you consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with 
         this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Information Collected by Us</h3>
      <p>We collect personal information (name, email, WhatsApp number) that exclusively 
         identifies you. We use this data to contact you and for unique identification.
      </p>
      <h3>Information Collected by Third-party</h3>
      <p>Third-party service providers may collect non-personal information through various 
         technologies when you interact with the Site or receive emails from us. This includes 
         device information (such as IP address, geolocation, browser details), usage information 
         (such as log files, clickstream data, search history), and location information (if enabled). 
         Some third parties may also use these technologies for targeted advertising, but they are not 
         governed by this Privacy Policy and do not have access to your personal information from us. 
         They may track your anonymous internet usage across websites beyond our Site. You can modify 
         your browser settings to decline cookies, but it may affect your access to the Site.
      </p>
      <h3>Changes to the Privacy Policy</h3>
      <p>
         As our Site evolves, we may introduce new services and features that could impact our 
         Privacy Policy. If any changes occur due to these additions or modifications in privacy 
         practices or applicable laws, this Privacy Policy will be updated accordingly. 
         We will provide prominent notice on the Site if there are material changes in 
         how we use your personal information. We will not, however, make changes that 
         reduce the level of protection for previously collected personal information without 
         your explicit consent. By using our Site, you agree to the practices outlined in this 
         Privacy Policy. If you disagree with the terms, please refrain from using the Site. 
         We reserve the right to modify or amend the Privacy Policy without notice. 
         All changes will take effect 24 hours after posting, and your continued use of the 
         Site after such changes constitutes acceptance. 
      </p>
      <h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
      <p>ACE makes efforts to protect and secure your personal information, 
         but no method of data storage or transmission can be completely secure. 
         ACE cannot guarantee the security of information you transmit to us.
      </p>
      <h3>Transfer of Ownership</h3>
      <p>In the event of a change in ownership or corporate structure, 
         including asset sales or mergers, we may transfer your information to 
         the acquiring or merged company. We strive to require the acquiring party to 
         adhere to this Privacy Policy, but we cannot guarantee their privacy practices 
         will remain the same.
      </p>
      <h3>For Non-India Users</h3>
      <p>If you are located outside India, you should be aware that your personally 
         identifiable information will be transferred to India, the laws of which may be 
         deemed by your country to have inadequate data protection. If you are located in 
         a country outside India, and voluntarily submit personally identifiable information 
         to us on the Site, you thereby consent to the general use of such information as 
         provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to, and/or 
         storage of that information in India.
